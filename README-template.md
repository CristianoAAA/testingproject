## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Visual Code Editor


### What I learned

I learned how i can from one div, create some divs inside the div and give different properties to each one of them and create a beautiful multi-color card. Also i learned how to set the border-radius to only two corners of the div with the following way:
```css
#sedans {
border-radius: 7px 0px 0px 7px;
}
```
I learned a lot about margins though, how many things can be placed in the right place with margins also.

### Continued development

I want to improve in flexbox because it's a very important technique in our todays world and i'm still kind of confused in flexbox, also i want to improve my styles, like being able to identify the color, font size etc just by look at the image, acquire more experience at programming, learn a programming language like JavaScript, get better at CSS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN DOCS WEB Article about border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) - This article helped me understand how can i set the border-radius to only some corners of the divs and don't need to be all 4 corners at once.
- [Game about Grid Layout](https://codingfantasy.com/games/css-grid-attack/play) - This amazing game mad eme understand grid layout and how i could use it on my solution, it helped me out a lot.
